## Building

I only ever build on windows with vs2022 and I've included a solution file for this. Everything
should be compatible with mac or linux though. The only dependency is raylib5. If I
get access to a linux machine I'll try slapping together a quick makefile for it or if someone wants to
PR one then I'll definitely accept that.

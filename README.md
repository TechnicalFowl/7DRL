# 7DRL

Code for my entry to [7DRL 2024](https://itch.io/jam/7drl-challenge-2024). Prior to the event starting I'll be playing around with writing a custom roguelike engine to use for the event. 

Feel free to contact me on discord @technicalfowl

## Building

I only ever build on windows with vs2022 and I've included a solution file for this. Everything
should be more or less compatible with mac or linux though. The only dependencies are glfw3 and glew. If I
get access to a linux machine I'll try slapping together a quick makefile for it or if someone wants to
PR one then I'll definitely accept that.
